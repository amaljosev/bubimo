/// Single, app-wide entry point for turning a picked file, a cropped

///
/// # Why this exists
/// `image_picker` / `image_cropper` return a path into storage the app
/// does not own (OS media store, gallery cache, or a temp directory
/// depending on platform). That path is not a stable long-term
/// reference:
/// - the OS/gallery app can evict its own cache at any time, with no
///   relationship to whether *this* app is still running;
/// - if the user deletes the original photo from their gallery, some
///   picker implementations (particularly content-URI-based pickers on
///   newer Android) leave a dangling reference;
/// - the path is meaningless after a backup/restore onto a different
///   device — it never existed there.
///
/// Every feature that accepts a photo (diary entry images/backgrounds,
/// overlay images, profile avatar/header, theme headers) MUST call
/// [saveFile] (or [saveBytes], for anything that starts as raw bytes —
/// e.g. a network download) immediately after picking/cropping/
/// downloading, and store ONLY the path [saveFile]/[saveBytes] returns.
/// The original picker/cropper/download path is discarded once this
/// call returns — it must never reach a repository or the database.
///
/// This also directly enables two requirements: the app must work
/// fully offline (every background/sticker/photo the user has already
/// added is a local file under this app's own directory, never a
/// remote URL or a gallery reference that needs network/OS access to
/// resolve), and a future backup/restore feature can back up 100% of a
/// user's media by copying one directory tree
/// ([mediaRoot]) — it never needs to know about gallery URIs, content
/// providers, or per-feature storage quirks.
///
/// Registered as a lazy singleton in `injection.dart`, immediately
/// after `AppDatabase` — every feature's data source that touches
/// files depends on this the same way every feature's data source
/// depends on `AppDatabase` for rows.
